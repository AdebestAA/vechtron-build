Here are some common factors to consider:\n\n1. **Engine Problems**: Faulty spark plugs, dirty air filters, or malfunctioning fuel injectors can impact fuel efficiency.\n\n2. **Tire Pressure**: Under-inflated tires can increase rolling resistance, leading to higher fuel consumption.\n\n3. **Weight**: Carrying excess weight in the car can lead to increased fuel consumption.\n\n4. **Driving Habits**: Aggressive driving, rapid acceleration, and high-speed driving can all lead to poorer fuel economy.\n\n5. **Fuel Quality**: Using low-quality fuel may affect engine performance and efficiency.\n\n6. **Maintenance**: Neglecting regular maintenance can lead to decreased efficiency.\n\n7. **Air Conditioning Usage**: Using air conditioning frequently can also increase fuel consumption.\n\n8. **Poor Aerodynamics**: Added accessories like roof racks can create drag and reduce fuel efficiency.\n\nIf you would like more precise information, I can check the specific details of your car. Would you like me to do that?"
